# random-quote-generator

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).



## Description

It is a simple application that generates random quotes. A [.JSON file containing various quotes](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/nasrulhazim/54b659e43b1035215cd0ba1d4577ee80/raw/e3c6895ce42069f0ee7e991229064f167fe8ccdc/quotes.json) is fetched via [fetch()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) API, and then parsed to be stored in React component `state`. 

CSS stylization has been attempted with both normal .css file styling and React in-line styling for personal learning purposes.



## How to run

Simply run: `npm start` from the working directory. Website is deployed locally at: https://localhost:3000.
